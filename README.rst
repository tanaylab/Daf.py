Daf.py 0.1.0 - Data in Axes in Formats
======================================

`Daf.jl <https://github.com/tanaylab/Daf.jl>`_ is a Julia package which provides a uniform generic interface for
accessing 1D and 2D data arranged along some set of axes. This is a much-needed generalization of the `AnnData
<https://github.com/scverse/anndata>`_ functionality. This package (``Daf.py``) is a wrapper around the Julia package
that allows accessing ``Daf`` data from Python, using the `JuliaCall <https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl>`_
package.

Installation
------------

Just ``pip install daf``, like installing any other Python package.

Usage
-----

The Python package provides the same API as the Julia package, with the following modifications:

- (Most) functions are exposed as member functions of the ``DafReader`` and ``DafWriter`` classes (e.g., write
  ``reader.get_scalar("version")`` in Python instead of ``get_scalar(reader, "version")`` in Julia).

- There is no ``!`` suffix for functions that modify the data (e.g., write ``writer.set_scalar("version", "1.0")`` in
  Python instead of ``set_scalar!(writer, "version", "1.0")`` in Julia.

- ``Daf.jl`` supports importing and exporting ``AnnData`` objects. However, since it is a Julia package, these objects
  are **not** Python ``anndata`` objects; instead they use the implementation provides by the `Muon.jl
  <https://github.com/scverse/Muon.jl>`_ Julia package. That is, to import/export ``AnnData`` between ``Daf`` and
  Python, your best bet is to go through ``h5ad`` files.

See the Python API documentation (latest published: TODO, head revision: `here
<https://tanaylab.github.io/Daf.py/v0.1.0/html>`_) for details.
